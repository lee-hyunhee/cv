> ##  About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="me7.jpg">

I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2021. I have worked as a software developer for more than 10 years in many companies including SK affiliates and participated in many projects. I am a full-stack developer and researcher with extensive development experiences in machine learning, artificial intelligence, web, mobile, big data, data analysis, growth hacking, graphic design, etc. 

If you would like to know more about me, contact me, and I will send you the full version of my Curriculum Vitae (CV). The following is a brief summary of my CV.
